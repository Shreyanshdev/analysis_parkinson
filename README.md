Title: Parkinson's Disease Analysis
Name: Shreyansh Gupta


Overview of the Problem:
Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. It often starts with a slight tremor in one hand and gradually worsens over time, affecting daily activities. The aim of this analysis is to identify the key features that help in diagnosing Parkinson's disease accurately using machine learning techniques.

Dataset Used
The dataset utilized for this analysis contains voice recordings of patients with and without Parkinson's disease. It includes various vocal features extracted from the recordings that serve as indicators of the disease. These features will be analyzed to build and evaluate machine learning models for accurate classification.

Method to Solve the Problem:::
Data Exploration and Analysis: Understanding the dataset, analyzing patterns, and identifying relationships between different features.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
How to Handle Data
Data handling involves loading the dataset, exploring missing values, and dealing with outliers to ensure clean and reliable data for modeling.

Preprocessing Techniques:
Various preprocessing techniques such as normalization, feature scaling, and data splitting (training and testing sets) are employed to prepare the data for machine learning models.

Imbalance Handling:
Class imbalance, if present, is handled using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to ensure balanced representation of both classes.

ML Modeling:
Multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are used.
These models are compared based on their accuracy to select the best-performing model for diagnosing Parkinson's disease.

Proposed Results:
The best model based on accuracy is selected for predicting Parkinson's disease, and the feature importance is analyzed to understand the critical indicators of the disease.

Conclusion:
The analysis identifies the most suitable machine learning model for accurately diagnosing Parkinson's disease and highlights the most significant vocal features contributing to the prediction. This work can assist medical professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning for Parkinson's disease.
